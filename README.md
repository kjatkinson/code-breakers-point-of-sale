 A Point of Sale System for a fusion restaurant.
Step 1: Set Up the Backend (Flask API)
Clone the Repository (if not already done):

bash
Copy code
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd <your-repo-directory>
Set Up Python Environment:

Install dependencies:
bash
Copy code
pipenv install
Create .env File:

Copy the example environment file:
bash
Copy code
cp .env.example .env
Edit the .env file to include your database configuration and other necessary environment variables.
Set Up the Database:

Ensure your PostgreSQL server is running.
Update the DATABASE_URL in your .env file to match your PostgreSQL credentials.
Run migrations:
bash
Copy code
pipenv run migrate
pipenv run upgrade
Run the Flask Application:

bash
Copy code
pipenv run start
Step 2: Set Up the Frontend (React)
Navigate to the Frontend Directory: If your frontend code is in a subdirectory (e.g., frontend), navigate there:

bash
Copy code
cd frontend
Install Frontend Dependencies:

bash
Copy code
npm install
Start the Development Server:

bash
Copy code
npm run start
Step 3: Access Your Application
Once both the backend and frontend servers are running, you should be able to access your application in your web browser at the address specified (usually http://localhost:3000 for React and http://localhost:5000 for Flask).
